With the rapid increase in online transactions more and more people are using credit cards to complete their transactions . This has led to increase in the credit card frauds which has directly affected the individuals and the financial sector There is an urgent need to put a stop to credit card frauds. This paper aims to use machine learning algorithm rather than using the traditional algorithm .A comparative analysis is done between different machine learning algorithms namely Linear Regression , Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and K-nearest neighbour. Further the data is highly imbalanced so SMOTE oversampling algorithm is used for the models.

## About The Dataset 

The dataset contains  284,807 data entries which  are transactions made through credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholder. The dataset contains 31 attributes. Out  which  28 columns are not labelled appropriately due to confidentiality of the credit card data. These columns are labelled as V1, V2,V3……V28 and contain numerical value as the original data is converted into PCA values. Apart from these columns there are 3 other columns namely 'Time', 'Amount' and 'Class'. Here 'Class' is the target attribute  which contains categorical values 0 and 1 , where 0 is 'Genuine' or non-fraudulent transaction and 1 refers to 'Fraud transaction'.
